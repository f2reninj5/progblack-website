Additional Comments:

Colour scheme is quite difficult to read, especially the black text on the purple background.
Written work needed a little bit more content. Especially on the Open Source page.
HTML was superb.
We couldn't any author information i.e., small paragraph written about them
According to the GitHub commit history, one member had over 900 line changes whilst another had about 30.
Worked on consistently.
