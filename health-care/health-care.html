    <h1> Benefits of computing in healthcare to the society</h1>
    <h2><li>Ease of access</li></h2>
    <p> The collection of patients’ data is one of the most paramount aspects in the healthcare field. Medical data is essential for doctors to analyze the patient’s situation and illness and then to find a possible cure for it. In the past, patient records used to create large amounts of paperwork because everything was on paper and pen. Accessing past records was troublesome. However, with the advent of digitalisation, the medical information of patients can be keyed into a cloud-based, digitized system. This has provided extraordinary ease for specialists, patients, and medical billers to access with a click of a button, from anywhere at anytime.</p>

    <h2><li>Greater patient care</li></h2>
    <p>The use of technology can increase patient engagement, providing insight to help create hyper-targeted, personalized health and wellness plans. Devices in the form of wearables like fitness bands and other wirelessly connected devices like Fitbits can monitor one’s blood pressure and Electrocardiograph (ECG), giving patients and specialists access to personalized information. These devices can depict calorie count, exercise checks, appointments, blood pressure variations, etc.  

    Specialists can keep track of patients’ health more efficaciously, such as their adherence to treatment plans, etc. This is especially pertinent for elderly patients and those living alone, where their family members or concerned healthcare providers will be promptly alerted if any abnormality is detected. As such, such technological gadgets ensure that patients enjoy superlative care, enhancing the healthcare experience and quality for all.
